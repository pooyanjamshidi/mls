# Introduction
### Goal for Today

Familiarize students with the topic of the course and the instructor's expectations.

### New to International Relations? Not Sure How Things Work?

![You're Not Alone](trump-tillerson-haley.jpg)

I'll try to help.

# Structure of This Course
### Structure of This Course

- Intro/framework/method
    - Actor's interests, interactions, and institutions
    - Preliminary game theory, understanding of stats.
- War as bargaining, and its causes
    - Included: civil war and terrorism
- International economics
    - i.e. learn these lessons as we get set to relearn history's mistakes in the West.
    - Included: trade, monetary relations, and inequality
- The problems of the future: international law, human rights, and global warming

We'll give careful attention to the issue of inference too.

### Structure of This Course

- Also: expect a lot of data and data visualization. 

- I *love* playing with data and want you to better understand the world around you.
- Visualization with current (as possible) data may help your learning experience.

# POSC 1020 Syllabus
### Course Objectives

1. Gain a cursory knowledge of important topics in IR; prepare for upper-division courses with more focused applications in the field.

2. Understand conflict as bargaining process and explain why bargaining "breaks down" (i.e. war onset).

3. Learn that, despite popular commentary and outward appearances, terrorism is rational behavior and part of a bargaining process.

4. Appreciate the benefits of globalization and free trade, notwithstanding the externalities these policies can create.

5. Discuss current issues at the fore of international politics (e.g. human rights, global warming) and the problems we have trying to address these issues.

## Course Policy
### Grading Policy

| **Assignment** | **(Due) Date** | **Percent of Grade** |
|:-----------|:----------:|:----------------:|
| Attendance/Participation | | 10% |
| Map Quiz | Sept. 13 | 15% | 
| Midterm 1         | Oct. 4 | 20% |
| Midterm 2 | Nov. 15 | 25% |
| Final | Dec. 12, 8-10:30 a.m. | 30% |

### Attendance/Participation Policy

```{r attenddata, include=FALSE}
options(scipen=999)
Attend <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/teaching/attendance-grades-relationship.csv")
Attend$rgrade <- round(Attend$grade, 0)
Attend$perattend <- (Attend$attendance/Attend$max)*100
Attend <- subset(Attend, !is.na(rgrade))
Attend$name <- as.numeric(Attend$name)
Attend$id <- as.numeric(Attend$id)
Attend$term <- as.numeric(Attend$term)
Attend$class <- as.numeric(as.factor(Attend$class))
M1 <- lm(rgrade ~ perattend, Attend)
M2 <- lm(rgrade ~ perattend, data=subset(Attend, perattend >= 75))
library(broom)

M1df <- tidy(M1)
M2df <- tidy(M2)
library(ggplot2)
library(kfigr)
```

Effectively mandatory: I deduct all participation points after five unexcused absences.

- Don't ask me how many you missed. You'll know more than me.
- Each class you miss coincides with an estimated `r round(M1$coefficients[2], 3)*5` points in your overall grade.

Be prepared to answer questions. I might assign quizzes.

- Quizzes will be graded/weighted against your participation grade for the semester.

###

```{r attendplot, eval=T, echo=F, fig.height=8.5, fig.width = 14}

estdecrease <- round(M1df[2,2]*5, 3)

### Cell Phones, Laptops, etc...

Unless SDS says its mandatory, put your laptops/phones away during class.

- They are terrible learning devices. Take notes by hand instead.
- You're on Facebook or playing Pokemon Go anyway. Don't pretend you're not.


### Email Policy

I'm usually quick to respond to student e-mails. However, I may not if:

1. You could answer your question by reading the syllabus.
2. You missed a class for which there was no exam.
3. You want to know what you missed for the class you skipped.
4. You're protesting a grade without specific objections.
	- Read the syllabus about protesting a grade.
5. You want to know how many classes you missed.
6. You're requesting an extension on an assignment.
7. You're protesting that a late assignment is not actually "late".
8. You're grade-grubbing.
9. You want an extra credit opportunity.

### Make-up Exams

**No, *and don't bother asking***.

- Sniffles/headaches don't count. Soldier through it.
- University-sponsored events/holidays count, but give me two weeks advance.

Students with valid excuses have one week *at the most* to make up an exam.

### Disabilities Policy

I'm more than happy to accommodate, but:

- The student has to take the intiative. I can't.
- Do let me know privately after class if I should expect to hear from SDS soon.

If you require the Test Proctoring Center, *schedule your midterm and final now*.

- I will not spend my free time watching you take an exam.

# Etiquette and Expectations
### My Contact Information

- *Name*: Steve Miller (as in the band)
- *E-mail*: \textcolor{clemsonorange}{svmille@clemson.edu}
- *Office Hours*: TR: 1:30-3:30 p.m.
- *Office*: 230A Brackett Hall
- *Website*: \textcolor{clemsonorange}{posc1020.svmiller.com}

### Additional Course Materials

I don't like Canvas. I only intend to use it for:

- Turnitin (and grading the Turnitin assignments)
- Classwide e-mails

I do like making lectures publicly available, though.

- Check course website at [posc1020.svmiller.com](http://posc1020.svmiller.com)
- Check my Github repository (just in case): [github.com/svmiller/posc1020](http://github.com/svmiller/posc1020)

### My Expectations

I come off as a bit cruel in my expectations.

- I expect a lot, and I expect a commitment from you.
- Otherwise, why bother? Your job is to become "pro-ready."

I also expect it to be a bit difficult for you.

- My philosophy: if you 100% understand something the first time you read it, you didn't learn anything.
- Read and re-read if necessary.
- Lectures should help, but they're not sufficient. You need to read.

I take seriously the "science" of political science.

- This may not be intuitive, but I'm also eager to help in-class or office hours.


### Etiquette Concerns

In-class:

- Raise your hand and ask a question the *moment* something doesn't make sense.
    - I do have a bad habit of talking a bit fast.
- *Do the reading before class*. Seriously.
- Resist the urge to write down every word on a slide.
    - Listening is more important than reading in this context.

### Etiquette Concerns

Outside class: 

- **Resist the urge** to e-mail me if you missed a class (for which there wasn't an exam).
    - Short answer: you missed what was on the syllabus.
- Please use conventional e-mail etiquette.
    - This is a good professional exercise for you.
- Knock first, even when the door is open.
- You may not use my office supplies.
- I am not a study session. Come prepared with something specific to ask or discuss.
