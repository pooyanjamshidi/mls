Hello, I hope you are as excited as I am about CSCE 585: ML Systems course!

## Course Syllabus

First, please read the [Course Syllabus](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/mls/syllabus/CSCE585_Syllabus_Fall2025) very carefully.

## Prerequisites

CSCE 240 (Advanced Programming Techniques) or CSCE 206 (Scientific Applications Programming).

## Enrollment

* All CSE majors can enroll in this course as long as you meet the prereqs for the class [CSCE 240 or 206].
* Other majors can enroll in the class, they should sign up after the CSE majors and might have to fill out the [override request form](https://cse.sc.edu/undergraduate/forms/override-request).
* Graduate students (CSE and all other majors including Math, Engineering, Science, Psychology, Chemistry, Law, pretty much all) are encouraged to enroll in the class. This is a suitable class for anyone interested to know more about ML Systems. 

## Communication

We envision several routes of communication for this course:


* **Student-to-Instructor & Student-to-Student:** The only mode of communication between students, instructor, and TA will be all electronically through the following tools/services:

  - **Blackboard Collaborate Ultra:** All sync lectures will be through Blackboard Collaborate Ultra (they will be also recorded) at the same time the class is scheduled. Note that we will not have sync lectures all weeks. We will only have the sync lectures whenever is needed for question answering, review, discussions, project presentations, and guest lectures and these will be communicated via Piazza. I will pre-record some short lectures for most of the content in the syllabus.
  - **Piazza:** The main mode of electronic communication between students and TAs, as well as amongst students, will be through [Piazza](https://piazza.com/sc/fall2020/csce585). It is intended for general questions about the course, clarifications about assignments, questions about research, discussions about the material, and so on. All students *must* enroll in [Piazza](https://piazza.com/sc/fall2020/csce585).
  - **GitHub:** We will use GitHub for all projects and their deliverable. We will create repositories to share the specification of each project and you should commit your code there. We will only look at it when you want us to do so and for the final evaluation. Note that all project deliverables should be a push to the repositories for final evaluation. Please do not email any project deliverable to us, they will be simply ignored. Learning GitHub is easy and the TA can show how to use it.
  - **Gradescope:** We will use GradeScope for all assignments. All students are required to make an account at Gradescope and enroll using this code that will be provided on the course website.
  - **Slack:** I will also set up a workspace for the course.
  - **Email:** I would strongly encourage you to ask your question via Piazza so others can also benefit from the questions and learn from the answers. However, if you need to contact the instructor for something that cannot be shared with others (personal issues or something confidential), you can email me or the TA with the provided address. Before sending an email, please think whether it is really necessary or can be shared on Piazza (it is great and you must use it regularly throughout the course).
  - **Zoom:** The instructor and TA will use Zoom for one-2-one meetings or the project team if needed. These are all by appointment.

* **Student-to-Content:** All course materials (e.g., lectures, notes, project descriptions, templates, assignments, syllabus, policies) can be accessed via this [link](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/mls/). Note that I will update these materials throughout the semester, so to find out about the latest versions please regularly visit this link. I will announce any update of content via Piazza too.


## Attendance and class participation
We encourage all students to actively participate in the sync classes (by asking or answering questions, sharing experience, discussing project ideas, etc). Active participation will enhance your learning experience and that of the other students. We will record the lectures for those who cannot attend the sync lectures.

<!-- There will be also some quizzes that are designed to emphasize a salient issue in the lecture of the day or a previous lecture. Another purpose of quizzes is to take attendance.  -->


## Academic Integrity

I would encourage you to discuss or brainstorm with other students or professors about the assignments, projects, and homework, but submissions should acknowledge all collaborators and sources consulted. We will actively check for code and other kinds of plagiarism (both from current classmates and other available online sources). We trust you all to submit your work,
but be aware if you plagiarize from other students or online sources, you will simply fail this course. Also, all the potential Honor Code violations will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity, which has the authority to implement non-academic penalties as described in [STAF 6.25](http://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/staf625.pdf).


## Disabilities Policy

Reasonable accommodations are available for students with a documented disability. If you have a disability and may need accommodations to fully participate in this class, contact the Student Disability Resource Center:  803-777-6142, TDD 803-777-6744, email sadrc@mailbox.sc.edu, or stop by LeConte College Room 112A. All accommodations must be approved through the Student Disability Resource Center. [See](https://www.sa.sc.edu/sds/).


## Grading

Please consult with [Syllabus](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/mls/syllabus/CSCE585-MLSystems.pdf).

<!-- ## Regrading policy

If you believe an error has been made in the grading of one of your exams or assignments, you may resubmit it for a regrade. Because we will examine your entire submission in detail, your grade can go up or down as a result of a regrade request.
