## Coursework Template

Please use this [template](https://github.com/pooyanjamshidi/mls/blob/master/resources/coursework-template.zip) for submitting your written assignments.


## Topics [2021]

The course project is an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned in class to a problem of your interest. Potential projects must have these two components:
- `Machine Learning` algorithm: Any ML model class including neural networks or any good old-fashioned ML/AI.
- `Computer Systems`: The project should have at least one computer systems component: (i) Platform: Embedded, Realtime, Cloud, IoT, Edge; (ii) Systems issues such as scalability, performance, reliability; (iii) On-device ML: e.g., TinyML, AI on Edge; (iv) Trustworthy AI: Bias, Fairness, Robustness, Privacy, Security, Explainability, Interpretability, Interoperability; (v) Robot Learning, any project that makes robots more intelligent! 

The following categories also fit within the scope and I highly encourage students to consider such projects: 
* Building on top of an existing ML systems that you can find on GitHub, e.g., you can develop a tracking algorithm and develop a plugin for [DeepStream](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk)
* AI competitions and challenge problems, these are great project ideas for non-CS students, e.g., [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/) hosts many interesting competitions with prizes suitable for students from all background, e.g., (i) [Open Catalyst Challenge](https://opencatalystproject.org/) for Chemical Engineering students; (ii) [Neural Latents Benchmark](https://neurallatents.github.io/) for Neuroscience students; (iii) [The Robotic Vision Challenges](https://nikosuenderhauf.github.io/roboticvisionchallenges/) for students interested in robotics. 
* Hackathons, e.g., [PyTorch Annual Hackathon 2021](https://pytorch2021.devpost.com/), [AWS BugBust](https://aws.amazon.com/bugbust/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
* Systematic study of open source ML Systems via: (i) interview study (please make sure you design the interview study correctly before conducting the interviews) and/or (ii) Formulating interesting research questions about building ML systems, for example, contrasting testing practices for ML systems vs traditional software systems, collecting data from software repositories, and systematically extracting info from these repositories that answers your research questions.
* TinyML projects, you can find many ideas on [GitHub](https://github.com/gigwegbe/tinyml-papers-and-projects) and [TinyML community forum](https://discuss.tinymlx.org/c/projects/5)
* And, in general, any interesting ML systems project ideas, try [GitHub](https://github.com/NirantK/awesome-project-ideas), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/search/?q=systems&restrict_sr=1)

If you are unsure whether the project you have defined fits within the scope, please come and talk with me after class. If you believe that might be helpful for other students, please ask your question on Piazza or during class hours.

## Project Proposal [1 page]

* What is the **problem** that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting? 
* What **reading** will you examine to provide context and background? 
* What **data** will you use? If you are collecting new data, how will you do it? 
* What **method** or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? You don't have to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on. 
* How will you **evaluate** your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?

**Submission**: Please submit your proposal as a PDF on the college [dropbox](https://dropbox.cse.sc.edu/). **Only one person on your team should submit**. Please have this person add the rest of your team in the author list.

## Project Milestone [2-3 pages]

Your project milestone report should be between 2-3 pages using the provided template. The following is a suggested structure for your report:

- `Title, Author(s)`
- `Introduction`: this section introduces your problem, and the overall plan for approaching your problem
- `Problem statement`: Describe your problem precisely specifying the dataset to be used, expected results and evaluation
- `Technical Approach`: Describe the methods you intend to apply to solve the given problem
- `Intermediate/Preliminary Results`: State and evaluate your results up to the milestone

**Submission**: Please submit your milestone as a PDF on Gradescope. **Only one person on your team should submit**. Please have this person add the rest of your team in the author list.

## Final Report [6-8 pages]

Each group needs to write a project report (in addition to the IPython notebook, their content could overlap) of at least four-pages, not including references. 

The project report should be formatted similarly to a workshop paper, and should use the [ICML 2018 style](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2018/StyleAuthorInstructions).
I will post all the final reports online so that you can read about each others' work. If you do not want your writeup to be posted online, then please let me know at least a week in advance of the final writeup submission deadline.

The suggested structure:

- `Title, Author(s)`
- `Abstract`: Briefly describe your problem, approach, and key results. 
- `Introduction (10%)`: Describe the problem you are working on, why it's important, and an overview of your results.
- `Related Work (10%)`: Discuss published work that relates to your project. How is your approach similar or different from others?
- `Data (10%)`: Describe the data you are working with for your project. What type of data is it? Where did it come from? How much data are you working with? Did you have to do any preprocessing, filtering, or other special treatment to use this data in your project?
- `Methods (25%)`: Discuss your approach for solving the problems that you set up in the introduction. Why is your approach the right thing to do? Did you consider alternative approaches? You should include figures, diagrams, or tables to describe your method.
- `Experiments (40%)`: The exact experiments will vary depending on the project, but you might compare with previously published methods, use visualization techniques to gain insight into how your model works, discuss common failure modes of your choices. You should include graphs, tables, or other figures to illustrate your experimental results.
- `Conclusion (5%)`: Summarize your key results - what have you learned? Suggest ideas for future extensions or new applications of your ideas.
- `Supplementary Material`, not counted toward your 6-8 page limit and submitted as a separate file. 

Your supplementary material might include:
- `Source code`
- `IPython notebook, videos, interactive visualizations, demos, etc`.
