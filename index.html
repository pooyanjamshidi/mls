<h2>Audience:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Computer Scientists, Data Scientists, AI/ML/Systems/Math/Statistics Researchers</b> often make great progress at building models with cutting edge techniques but turning those models into products is challenging. For example, data scientists may work with unversioned notebooks on static data sets and focus on prediction accuracy while ignoring scalability, robustness, update latency, or operational costs.</li>
  <li><b>Software Engineers</b> are trained with clear specifications and tend to focus on code, but may not be aware of the difficulties of working with data and unreliable models. They have a large toolset for decision making and quality assurance but it is not obvious how to apply those to intelligent systems and their challenges. </li>
  <li><b>Scientists, Researchers, Engineers, Lawyers, Medical Experts, Physicians, Psychologists, Business Experts, and many other Professionals</b> have heard about AI/ML and would like to know more about the details and how to start or use AI/ML in their profession or their research. It is important to learn how to design ML systems in a principled and systematic way that satisfies certain properties like safety, bias, etc. If we do not learn about these important principles, we may have many ML systems that undermine our human values in our society.</li>
